1 Introduction
File System in the realm of computing is very basic and important feature. It’s a
system by which files are named, organized, and stored for retrieval [1]. Without
the help of operation System, it would be very difficult for us to identify and
retrieve data [1]. Thus, playing a crucial role in managing individual piece of
information.
The core of file system is its indexing method, determining how files are
organized on hard drive [3]. Depending on the operating system they employ
different indexing methods, influencing file retrieval efficiency [3].
File System has diverse forms each with unique structure and logic, proper-
ties of speed flexibility, security, size and more [2]. Some files are tailored for
specific use, like ISO 9660 and UDF are designed for optical discs [2].
File management is a process of maintaining any kind of data (such as video,
audio, documents) [4]. It also provides details like modification time, creation,
owner, location, and status of each file [4]. 
Computer users engage daily in file management activities such as creating
downloading, naming, moving, saving, copying, reviewing, navigating, search-
ing, reviewing, sharing and deleting files. File management is essentially an art
of systematically storing, naming, sorting and handling documents to facilitate
easy data retrieval in future [5].
A file management system is a type of software which is designed to handle
data file within computer system, specifically focusing on grouped files like of-
fice documents and records. The tasks performed by a file management system
in an operating system include creating new files, organizing them in specific
locations, facilitating quick file retrieval, storing files in directories for efficient
management, and enabling users to modify file data or names [5]. Ultimately, 
file management plays crucial role in helping users organize their valuable doc-
uments systematically, enhancing efficiency in their use.

Operating System Consists of 3 types of file structures namely –Sequential
File Structure, Indexed File Structure and Random or Direct File Structure [7].
In Sequential file structure data is stored in linear manner but not efficient for
random access, whereas Indexed File Structure uses an index with key values
for quick and direct access to records and thus its more efficient that sequential
access [7]. Random(or Direct) File Structure is the most efficient way because
it enables immediate access to records using unique identifiers [7].




2 How to run project
The project is written in bash script and some part is written in C language. It
will easily run in ubuntu environment. Further steps to run code–
• Firstly, download both AOS.sh and project.c file in ubuntu.
• Then open terminal and type ”bash AOS.sh”.
• Then it will show 14 options for the operation which you want to perform.
• You can choose anyone of them and follow futher instruction to perform
the required operation.



FUTURE WORK
The current version of file management system is like a starting point—it does
some basic things well. However, we’re aiming to make it much more powerful
in future by adding extra features and making improvements. Right now, users
have 14 different options to do things with their files and folders.

Looking forward, we are planning to study advanced file management con-
cepts in Linux, which is like learning more about ins and outs of how files are
handled in the operating system. This deeper understanding will help us en-
hance and refine the system. As a result, we can provide users with more choices
and make the whole process of managing files even easier and more convenient.
Our goal is to keep refining and upgrading the system to make it the best it can
be for everyone.
Our main objective is to constantly innovate and develop. Our dedication lies
in our continuous system upgrades, which ultimately seek to make the system
the most useful tool for consumers. We want to improve the user experience
and make file management easier for everyone who uses the system, which is
why we prioritize user experience and never stop trying to make improvements.


5 CONCLUSION
The project covers basic functions necessary for efficient file administration,
including adding new files, removing old ones, renaming files, and changing
their contents. The features work smoothly when the user enters text using the
keyboard, making the experience simple to use. The implementation makes use
of two strategies, fusing the advantages of bash scripting and the C programming
language.
This design decision puts accessibility first in addition to guaranteeing the
file management system’s dependability and effectiveness. Anyone with a basic
understanding of computers may easily navigate and operate the system because
to its simple and easy-to-use user interface. A wide variety of users may easily
complete different file management activities thanks to the system’s easy design,
regardless of whether they need to add new files, remove undesired ones, or
make adjustments. The intention is to provide a system that enables users to
manage files effectively and conveniently, irrespective of their level of technical
proficiency.
